<h2>More feeds</h2>

<p>
  This pages used to list all the known feeds, but the list was getting much too long, so now it just
  shows a few selected applications. Hopefully, other people will set up more specialised lists for particular
  groups of people.
</p>

<p>
  For example, the <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/ZeroInstall'>ROX Zero Install software index</a>
lists those programs which are designed for use with the ROX desktop.
</p>

<p>
  For a complete list of all known feeds, see the <a href='http://roscidus.com/0mirror/'>feed mirror site</a>.

If you want to make additional programs available this way, please read the
<a href='injector-packagers.html'>packaging guide</a>.
