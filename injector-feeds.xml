<h2>Zero Install feeds</h2>

<p>
Here are some sites that have already started providing software via this system. If you find any
more, write to the list to let us know and we will add them here.
</p>

<p>
To get these programs, drag the program's title from your web-browser to your installer.
If you need more help, consult the <a href='injector.html'>injector
installation instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: The aim of this page is to list <i>all</i> feeds, regardless of their quality. My hope is that
other people will set up sites listing sub-sets of these suitable for different groups of users. For
example, someone might publish a page linking to programs especially suitable for children, while
someone else lists programs good for audio processing, etc. As an example, the
<a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/ZeroInstall'>ROX Zero Install software index</a>
lists those programs which are designed for use with the ROX desktop.
