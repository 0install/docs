  <summary>a Tron clone in 3D</summary>
  <description>&quot;A Tron clone in 3D&quot;.

This has been the tagline of Armagetron, since, well, a very long time, and is
probably the shortest and most accurate description possible. Tron was an
arcade game based on the movie of the same name, release by Disney in 1982. The
original game consisted of 4 sub-games, the only one of concern is the 'Light
Cycles' one, in which the player uses a left/right joystick to control a 'Light
Cycle' which leaves a wall behind it wherever the cycle it goes, turning only
at 90 degree angles. The player must then get the AI to crash into their wall
while avoiding hitting the AI's own wall themselves. Those were the humble
beginnings of Armagetron Advanced's game play, which has now blossomed into 16
player mayhem, with highly advanced AI, network game play, and of course all in
a 3D environment.
