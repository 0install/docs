<h2>Get Involved!</h2>

<p>
The Zero Install project is run by volunteers, and we're always happy to have new users, developers and evangelists! If you'd like to join us, please introduce yourself on our friendly <a href='support.html'>mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are some suggestions for things you might like to try:
</p>


<h3>Creating packages</h3>
<p>
If you've written some programs of your own, try <a href='injector-packagers.html'>making feeds for them</a>. Report your experiences, bugs found and suggestions to the mailing list.
</p>

<h3>Evangelism</h3>
<p>
Zero Install has been working since 2003, but still many people haven't even heard of us. Writing articles for blogs, news sites, etc would be a great help. Let us know on the mailing list if an article gets published - we're always interested in feedback.
</p>
<p>
Also, asking software authors if they'd be interested in publishing a feed would be really useful.
</p>

<h3>Become a 0install developer</h3>
<p>
There's a list of features waiting to be implemented on the <a href='roadmap.html'>roadmap page</a>. To understand the system, some good starting points are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='using-git.html'>Getting the code using Git</a></li>
  <li><a href='interface-spec.html'>The feed file format specification</a></li>
  <li><a href='injector-design.html'>The design of 0install</a> (includes a diagram showing the main objects at the end).</li>
  <li><a href='api-example.html'>API example</a> (a simple example showing how to use the Python API).</li>
</ul>
</html>
