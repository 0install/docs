This section describes Zero Install in general rather than giving details specific to either of the implementations.
If you want help using one of them, jump to that section instead:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href='injector.html'>The Injector</a></dt>
<dd>The injector is a pure Python implementation of Zero Install. It provides the <b>0launch</b> command, and
can be installed by anyone.
</dd>

<dt><a href='filesystem.html'>The /uri/0install filesystem</a></dt>
<dd>
The filesystem uses a kernel module to provide the <b>/uri/0install</b> filesystem. This only works on Linux, and
you need to be root to install it (but once installed other software can be fetched by non-root users).
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
You should also click on one of the two links above if you're looking for <b>screenshots</b>. There is also
a <a href='matrix.html'>matrix comparing various different installation systems</a> for a quick overview of
how Zero Install compares with other systems.
