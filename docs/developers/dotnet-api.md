title: .NET API

The Zero Install .NET API provides the basis for [Zero Install for Windows](../details/windows.md).

You can also use it to integrate Zero Install features into your own application. Reference the [NuGet packages](https://github.com/0install/0install-dotnet#nuget-packages) See the [API Documentation](https://dotnet.0install.net) for information on how to use them.
