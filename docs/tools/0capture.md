0capture is a command-line tool for generating Zero Install feeds with metadata for [desktop integration](../details/desktop-integration.md). This currently only works on Windows.

To setup 0capture on your system you can run:

```
0install add 0capture https://github.com/0install/0capture
```

If you prefer a GUI, you can use the "New Feed Wizard" in the Windows version of [0publish-gui](0publish-gui.md), which provides similar functionality.

## Usage

### First snapshot

First you need to capture a snapshot of the current state of your system by running:

```
0capture start myapp.snapshot
```

This will create a file named `myapp.snapshot` storing information such as the currently installed binaries, registered file handlers, etc..

### App installation

Now you can install the app you wish to capture using its regular installer.

### Second snapshot

Once the app is installed you can run:

```
0capture finish myapp.snapshot myapp.xml --collect-files=myapp.zip
```

This create another snapshot of the system state and compare it with the previously stored one. By comparing the two snapshot, 0capture can then infer which [capabilities](../specifications/capabilities.md) the app has and uses this to generate the feed file `myapp.xml` along with an archive containing the app's binaries named `myapp.zip`.

## FAQ

Do I need to repeat this for each release of the app I captured?
:   If the app provides non-installer archives, you can modify the feed to use those instead of the archive generated by `--collect-files`. Then you'll only need to run 0capture once to get the desktop integration capabilities.

The generated feed seems to be missing some capabilities. How can I improve the quality of the generated feed?
:   Try running 0capture and the app's installer in an otherwise pristine VM.
