title: Catalog files

This document is a formal description of the XML catalog format. A catalog contains meta-data for a collection of [feeds](feed.md). Catalogs make it easier to find feeds for specific applications.

# Syntax

Catalog files have the following syntax (`?` follows optional items, `*` means zero-or-more, order of elements is not important, and extension elements can appear anywhere as long as they use a different namespace):

```xml
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<catalog xmlns='http://0install.de/schema/injector/catalog'>
  <interface uri='...' xmlns='http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/2004/injector/interface'>
    <name>...</name>
    <summary>...</summary>
    <description>...</description> ?
    <homepage>...</homepage> ?
    <category type='...' ? >...</category> *
    <needs-terminal/> ?  
    <icon type='...' href='...'/> *
    <entry-point command='...' binary-name='...' ? /> *
  </interface> *
</catalog>
```

The syntax within `<interface>` elements is identical to that of [feeds](feed.md).

Each `<interface>` element represents a feed and contains a copy of that feed's body. However, `<implementation>`, `<group>`, `<feed>`, `<feed-for>` and `<replaced-by>` elements are omitted. They should instead be taken from the original feed, which can be downloaded from the specified `uri` when required.

## Digital signatures

When a catalog is downloaded from the web, it must contain a digital signature. A catalog is signed by appending an XML comment block of the form:

```xml
<!-- Base64 Signature
iD8DBQBEXM/qrgeCgFmlPMERArNSAKDBuNz5SQMZ8rwJmW2fhNHJwor6KwCgwx7XEfY+6gUC90rJ
b5eCY+I8HNA=

-->
```

This block **must** go at the end of the file, and contains a Base64-encoded version of the file that would be created by using `gpg --detach-sign` on the original feed. The signature block must start on a new line, may not contain anything except valid base64 characters, and nothing may follow the signature block.

This is identical to the [signature format used by feeds](feed.md#digital-signatures).

# Generating

Catalog files are automatically generated by [0repo](../tools/0repo.md).

You can also manually generate a catalog from a set of feeds downloaded to a local directory:

```shell
$ 0install run --command=0publish http://0install.de/feeds/ZeroInstall_Tools.xml feeds/*.xml --catalog=catalog.xml --xmlsign
```

!!! note
    A catalog generated like this points to the locations the feeds originally came from, not the local XML files on your disk.

# Usage

Catalog files are currently only used by [Zero Install for Windows](../details/windows.md).

You can search for feeds in catalogs like this:

```shell
$ 0install catalog search KEYWORD
```

See the [command-line interface documentation](../details/cli.md#catalog_search) for more commands.

## Short names

Catalogs allow you to use short names on the command-line instead of entering full feed URIs. Short names are either equal to the application `<name>` as listed in the catalog (spaces replaced with dashes) or the application's `binary-name` specified in an `<entry-point>`.

For example, instead of `0install run https://apps.0install.net/gui/vlc.xml` you can use:

- `0install run vlc-media-player` (application name) or
- `0install run vlc` (executable file name)

## GUI

The main GUI of Zero Install for Windows displays a list of available applications populated by one or more catalogs. The default catalog can be extended with or replaced by custom catalogs in the *Catalog* tab of the *Options* window.
