  Zero Install downloads files from several different places.
</p>

<p>
  First, it downloads from the author's web-site a list of versions of the application that are available and what other libraries the application requires. Zero Install then downloads information about those libraries too, from their web-sites.
</p>

<p>
  These lists are signed by the developer who published them. When you use software from a developer for the first time, Zero Install asks you to confirm that you trust this person's signature. It asks your <i>Key information server</i> for extra information to help you decide.</p>

<p>Finally, it chooses an appropriate set of versions and downloads those packages.

  The <a href='http://roscidus.com/0mirror/'>Mirror server</a> is used as a backup if the project servers don't respond or return an error.
