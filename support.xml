<h2 id='lists'>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>The project has a single mailing list, which can be used for sending
bug reports, patches, suggestions, questions, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note: You cannot post without subscribing, due to the large amount of spam we
were getting.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read via web interface: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=zero-install-devel">SourceForge</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/zero-install-devel">Subscribe to get emails</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='bugs'>Bug tracker</h2>

<p>Bugs can also be filed on the bug tracker. However, it's best to post
non-trivial bugs to the mailing list too, as more people will see them
there.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/0install/0install/issues'>New issue tracker on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='email'>Email</h2>

<p>
If possible, please send questions and comments to the mailing list, so that other people
see them and they appear in the searchable archives. It's also more likely that
you'll get a reply if more people see your question. Messages sent directly to
me will be forwarded to the mailing list first, unless you specifically ask me
not to do this.
</p>

<p>
However, reports of security problems or requests for interviews may be
<a href='http://sourceforge.net/users/tal197/'>sent by email</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='commercial'>Commercial support</h2>

<p>
If you require commercial support, you can either ask on the mailing list (see above) or email.
Please say what kind of support you need: do you want a new feature implemented, or help making your existing application available?
