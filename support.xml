<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>The project has a single mailing list, which can be used for sending
bug reports, patches, suggestions, questions, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note: You cannot post without subscribing, due to the large amount of spam we
were getting, but you can subscribe and then disable mail delivery if you
prefer to read the list via one of the web interfaces below rather than by
getting emails.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read with news-reader: <a href="news://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel">news://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel</a></li>
  <li>Read via web interface: <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel">gmane</a>, 
		    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=zero-install-devel">SourceForce</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/zero-install-devel">Subscribe to get emails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If clicking on the news: link above directly doesn't work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load <b>Pan</b> (or some other news-reader) and add <b>news.gmane.org</b> as a new server (<b>Tools-&gt;News
Servers</b>).</li>
<li>Select <b>gmane</b> using the <b>Server</b> menu.</li>
<li>Type <b>zero-install</b> into the group search box (top left) and press
<b>Return</b> to find the group.</li>
<li>You can right click over the group and choose <b>Subscribe</b> from the
menu to make it easier to find them in future. Note that 'Subscribing' to a
news group just marks it as interesting to your news-reader. It is
different to subscribing to get emails.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bug tracker</h2>

<p>Bugs can also be filed on the bug tracker. However, it's best to post
non-trivial bugs to the mailing list too, as more people will see them
there.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76468&amp;atid=547191">View open bugs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=76468&amp;atid=547191">Submit a new bug</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>
Please do not contact me by email directly. This prevents other people from
seeing the question and its answer (on the lists or the searchable archives),
and means I have to answer the same questions over and over again. It's also
more likely that you'll get a reply if more people see your question. Messages
sent directly to me will most likely either be ignored or bounced to the
mailing list anyway.
</p>

<p>
The only exceptions to this are reports of security problems and requests for
interviews, which may be sent by email.
</p>

<h2>Commercial support</h2>

<p>
If you require commercial support, please ask on the mailing list (see above). Remember to say what kind of support you
need: do you need a new feature implemented, or help making your existing application available?
