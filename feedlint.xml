<h2>FeedLint: Check your feeds</h2>

<program name='FeedLint'
	 author='Thomas Leonard'
	 feed='http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/FeedLint.xml'
	 git='http://repo.or.cz/w/FeedLint.git'
	 license='GNU General Public License'/>

<p>
If you maintain a number of feeds, each with several versions of your programs, how do you
know that all the download links are still OK? Run FeedLint on your feeds from time-to-time
to check.
</p>

<p style='clear: both'>
To use it, pass the URLs of the feeds to check as arguments, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0alias feedlint http://0install.net/2007/interfaces/FeedLint.xml</b>
$ <b>feedlint http://my/feed.xml</b>
</pre>

<p>
You can pass multiple feeds as arguments and it will check all of them. For each feed, it will:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Download the feed and check it can be read by 0launch.</li>
 <li>Check that all signatures are correct and by keys on your keyring.</li>
 <li>Check that each signature's GPG key can be downloaded.</li>
 <li>Check that the homepage and icon URLs work.</li>
 <li>Get the size of each implementation archive and check that it matches the size in the feed.</li>
 <li>Warn about releases marked as Testing which are more than one week old.</li>
 <li>Recursively check any sub-feeds and dependencies listed in the feed (if run with <b>-d</b>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: to check all feeds in your domain (e.g. <b>example.com</b>):</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch --list example.com | xargs feedlint</b>
</pre>

<h2>Sample output</h2>

<p>
Here we ask it to check Edit's feed (and it also checks ROX-Lib, on which Edit depends; note
that this mode now requires the <b>-d</b> option to be used):
