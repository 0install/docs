<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
From 2007-09-10 to 2007-10-6, we ran a survey on the 0install.net web-site to collect
feedback. This is the write-up! The raw data and the scripts used generate the charts
can be found in the <a href='2007/survey'>2007/survey</a> directory. The only edit was
to obscure an email address in one of the comments to avoid spam.
</p>

<p>
The survey was advertised in various places:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Respondant 1 is me.</li>
<li>Then I <a href='http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/1783'>announced it</a> on the Zero Install mailing list (2007-09-10), which
probably corresponds to the next five responses.</li>
<li>Then I <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/node/756'>posted an announcement</a> to the ROX web-site later the same day.</li>
<li>It then <a href='http://linuxfr.org/~MilkaJinka/25303.html'>appeared on linuxfr.org</a> on the 16th (which probably accounts
for French being the second most popular language).</li>
<li>I <a href='https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/packaging/2007-September/000502.html'>posted on the LSB packaging list</a> on the 14th Sep.</li>
<li>I <a href='http://lwn.net/Articles/249934/'>submitted it to lwn.net</a>, which made the announcement visible only to
subscribers for the first week (starting on the 20th), and then to everyone (from the 27th).</li>
<li>Finally, I <a href='http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.desktop.xfce.user/17096'>posted on the Xfce user's list</a> on the 4th Oct.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In total, 199 people started filling in the survey, with 66 completing it. Only
the results from those who completed it are analysed here.
</p>

<p>
The survey had three sections: about the user, about using Zero Install and
an optional section on publishing software using Zero Install.
</p>

<h2>About the respondants</h2>

<p>The survey starts with a few questions about the respondants
themselves (well, it's nice to start with some easy questions!):</p>

<h3>What is your native language?</h3>

<p>
  Quite a good range of languages here. Surprisingly, none of the respondants mentioned anything about better localisation support in their comments.
</p>

</p>

<h3>How old are you?</h3>

</p>

<h3>Which platforms do you use?</h3>

<p>
This questions was just about the platforms that the respondants used, not just
those they used with Zero Install.
</p>

<p>
We all know Ubuntu (which here included Debian too) is popular at the moment,
but the other Linux flavours aren't even close. I should have added a write-in
field for Other; lots of people aren't using any of the suggested options.
</p>

</p>

<h3>What architectures do you use?</h3>

<p>
We have a surprisingly varied set of architectures. I'm currently trying to get a project on the OpenSUSE build service for Zero Install, which
should allow us to build binaries for multiple architectures automatically. So far, <a href='http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.suse.opensuse.buildservice/3331'>I haven't been able to attract the attention of an admin</a>, though. That would provide support for the two most popular architectures. If anyone has an automatic build system for other platforms, let us know. You should be
able to set it up to automatically download, compile and publish new versions using <a href='0compile.html'>0compile</a>.
</p>

<h3>How did you hear about Zero Install?</h3>

<p>
Oops. I forgot to list pro-linux.de as an option. They've run lots of articles about Zero Install! linuxfr.org linked to the survey; lots of people arrived that way!

<h2>Running programs with Zero Install</h2>

<h3>What operating systems / distributions do you use Zero Install with?</h3>

<p>
When it comes to actually using Zero Install, Ubuntu increases its lead over the others even further. I tried it once on a Windows machine but I had some weird DLL problems, but it
looks like someone managed to get it working (the other Windows vote corresponds to the <q>Would like</q> comment below).
</p>

<h3>How have you used Zero Install so far?</h3>

<p>
Lots of the survey respondants haven't used it yet (only 39 / 66 had). I'd count <q>Contributed patches</q> as being a developer, though the respondant didn't. It does bring up the
point that the core devel team is a bit small at the moment ;-)

</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Other comments: </strong><q>Contributed Patches</q>, <q>Can help with development for windows</q>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>What are the main programs you run using Zero Install, if any?</h3>

<p>
The various ROX applications dominate this list. Blender, Sonata, S.C.O.U.R.G.E, LyX, Inkspace and Saxm2s are the non-ROX ones mentioned. The feeds for the ROX apps and for Saxm2s are
maintained by their upstream authors, whereas most of the other programs are made available by 3rd-parties and thus less official and/or less well maintained.
</p>

<h3>As a user, how important are these goals to you?</h3>

<p>
Most of the time, the only reason for installing a program as root is so that a single copy can be shared between multiple users. Since Zero Install can support
<a href='sharing.html'>sharing between untrusted and unprivileged users</a>, users can install without needing root access.
</p>

<p>
I confess to being puzzled by the four people who find not being able to install without root access is an advantage to them as a user. Don't care is a reasonable answer here
(lots of people own their own machines), but plenty of people clearly do want to install things easily on machines where they don't have root access.
</p>

<p>
 <img style='padding-left: 200px' src='2007/survey/charts/I_want_to_install_without_needing_root_access.png' width='547' height='142' alt='I want to install without needing root access'/>
</p>

<p>
Zero Install is decentralised; if you can publish a web-page, you can publish
software. Such programs are still first-class citizens; they get automatic
dependancy resolution and automatic updates. Lots of people want to use it to
install uncommon software. That's probably due to the large number of ROX users
(most distributions don't include most of ROX).
</p>

<p>
 <img style='padding-left: 200px' src='2007/survey/charts/I_want_to_install_less_common_software_that_isn&apos;t_in_my_distribution.png' width='677' height='142' alt='I want to install less common software that isn&apos;t in my distribution'/>
</p>

<p>
The large number of people who don't care about giving every program they install root access is a bit concerning, but understandable as in the past Linux hasn't been a target of
much malware. With Linux becoming more mainstream, that's likely to change over the next few years and we may see the current complacency start to disappear.
</p>

<p>
Then again, they may be on single user machines (where not installing as root
has fewer immediate benefits) and not believe that future sandboxing
technologies built on this will turn out to be workable.
My impression, though, has been that presenting Zero Install as "installation made easy"
is interesting to people, while if I talk about "better security" they quickly
lose interest.

</p>

<p>
Installing newer versions is popular. It's very frustrating when you hit a bug, only to have the developers say <q>Well, we fixed that 3 months ago!</q>, but you have to endure the
buggy behaviour for another three months waiting your distribution to put out a new release.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
And finally, the most popular of all: avoiding conflicts. In Zero Install, there is no concept of "the" installed version of a library. While there is often only one version, shared by
many programs, Zero Install deals with conflicts automatically by installing multiple versions at once, as many as are needed.
</p>

</p>

<h3>How do you integrate Zero Install with your (desktop) environment?</h3>

<p>
The core of Zero Install is 0launch, which takes a URI and runs the named program. Since that's not a very friendly interface the idea is to add short-cuts to your desktop
environment. Several such interfaces are provided, some more well developed than others:
</p>

</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Other comments: </strong><q>0launch in GNOME's automatically run programmes</q>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
The big surprise here is the extremely low number of people using it with Xfce, which has pretty good support built into its panel. Feedback in the past from those who have used it
has been very positive, but the feature seems little known.
</p>

<h3>How could Zero Install integrate better with your desktop environment?</h3>

<blockquote><p><q>Dragging to the ROX panel could add a launcher automatically.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It would be nice to be able to drag or copy+pase a feed from the web right on to one's desktop / panel / filer and have a launcher/.desktop file/ or whatever appear without any extra dialogs or applications to deal with.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Good ideas. Just a question of getting the time to do it.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>MIME type handler for execution directly from web pages.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of people ask for this, but it's hard to do it securely. It's easy to make a link in a web page look innocuous, and letting any random web-page start the install
process seems risky. Firefox uses this method for installing extensions, and has ended up having to add a load of features to stop it from being abused (e.g. a count-down
timer after you click a link, as well as a white-list of allowed sites). Adding something to the right-click menu might work, though.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>That apps can be visible in menus (xdg?) without laucnhing Zero2Desktop each time</q></p></blockquote>

<p>I don't understand this one.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Have AddApp/Zero2Desktop install SendTo items. (Needs mime-types element in interfaces)</q></p></blockquote>

<p>MIME types are an area that should be improved, but we need to guard against the situation where applications fight over MIME types. One possiblity would be to seach the menus
when you ask to open something. e.g. <q>No application is registered to handle LyX files. However, the application LyX which you have placed in your Office menu can open it...</q></p>

<blockquote><p><q>I'm using E17 Desktop Shell at this moment and there is an Ibar which holds the launchers off apps, KDE4 and Gnome and thinking something similar (kicker or gdesklets with a mac like launcher), would be nice to have some kind of universal drag &amp; drop support for all this alternatives (I don't know if there is a standard for that). May be associations with mime types would be neat, but they can be provided by rox filler.</q></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><q>* Being the only install method for a whole distribution, or transparent
* Being able to share an installed software between users (MOST IMPORTANT)</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Sharing is <a href='sharing.html'>already supported</a>!</p>

<blockquote><p><q>With rox desktop</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Integration with PackageKit ?</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I was unaware of Zero2Desktop; I will have to check that out</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It would be nice to have a SMALL control center that is uniform in functionality, be it on qt/kde or gtk/gnome</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, Zero2Desktop is not only badly-named, but rather incomplete too. Hopefully someone will send patches...</p>

<blockquote><p><q>I use gnome and ubuntu, it could have lots more tooltips, demos, wizards, drag n drops, etc.
Well overall alot more intuitive for novice similar to windows or mac programs installations (next, next, finish..) :)</q></p></blockquote>


<h3>What security software do you use or want to use with Zero Install?</h3>

<p>
Surprisingly little interest in Plash, even though this seems to offer the possibility of very good protection. SELinux and AppArmor policies are set ahead of time by the
admin, which means that they tend to be rather general, yet at the same time overly limiting (e.g. "Acroread can read /**/*.pdf files"), while Plash can be much more specific
(e.g. "Acroread can read any file I drag to it"). Of course, both static admin-set policies and dynamic user-set policies can be used together.

<blockquote><p><strong>Other comments: </strong><q>Don't know enough about these</q>, <q>UML</q>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href='http://0install.net/2007/3rd-party/UserModeLinux.xml'>User-Mode-Linux</a> is itself available though Zero Install, and using it for sandboxing is a good idea.
For bonus points, devise a way to let an (untrusted) process running under UML add packages to the host's cache, so that they are shared between all UML virtual machines.

<blockquote><p><q>Listing dependencies of packages. i.e. I'm not sure libc5 should be a 0install package, and Ubuntu doesn't have a package, but some binary distributions (i.e. Firefox) are compiled against libc5. I can imagine many packages would fail without Python, or GTK, but it somehow seems like a lot of work packaging things like that that we assume are on most systems. I certainly don't want to be packaging a lot of dependencies just to get one package working. We could do with a core library of dependencies being packaged, and then everybody could link to them, and perhaps they could be included in 0publish as standard dependencies. Also, it may be possible to examine the current machine to see if the dependencies are already there - i.e. check if GTK exists at a specified version, if not download the 0install package, if it is we're alright. If 0install is to become more widely-adopted, we need more stringent dependency-listing because more people will be using it on more systems.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Wanting to go in an app's cache folder for whatever reason, and having to randomly try hex-string-named folders till I find the right one. I would like them to be called "PackageName - VersionNumber" etc. with the hexadecimal hash string stored in a file inside each directory.

Something like this:
implementations/ROX-Filer 1.1/2A32BDF834C.hash
And if someone installed a bunch of different packages with the same name and version, there could be a naming scheme like
ROX-Filer 1.1 (1)/2A32BDF834C.hash
ROX-Filer 1.1 (2)/325986BD6F3.hash
ROX-Filer 1.1 (3)/235B5DCD602.hash
Just an idea.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It's somewhat difficult/confusing to uninstall applications.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>That it's called "zero install" yet people are installing stuff. I have gotten used to the term now...</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Tries to do too much things at once (one can create packages from deb packages, Autopackage, Kilk, sources, etc...). Tries to be a onze-size-fits-all app, which can lead to too much complexity.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The fact that it says "will automatically download dependancies" and then when I run the program I get a list saying "you are missing ......."</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Installing it, from the point of view of the end user, and the problem is not getting it by default on popular distros, but integrated to the web browsing experience of the casual unix desktop user. Something like a firefox plugin/extension would help a lot or the way that autopackage creates packages which install autopackage when it is not present. We need somekind of bootstraping for 0install, from the usual unix desktop experience, to the 0install experience and links to me between both experience can be made in the browser via extensions/plugins; in the mime types: you try to open a file that doesn't have the proper viewer and voilá, you get it via 0install; or in bundles: you get a 0install self contained bundle that, when is launched install 0install, and after that you can use to its full potential --even sharing dependencies (somekind of mix between the autopackage way and the 0install way)</q></p></blockquote>

5.c. Non-Portage Maintained Software

Using Portage with Self-Maintained Software

In some cases you want to configure, install and maintain software yourself without having Portage automate the process for you, even though Portage can provide the software titles. Known cases are kernel sources and nvidia drivers. You can configure Portage so it knows that a certain pack stage is manually installed on your system. This process is called injecting and supported by Portage through the /etc/portage/profile/package.provided file.

For instance, if you want to inform Portage about gentoo-sources-2.6.11.6 which you've installed manually, add the following line to /etc/portage/profile/package.provided:

Code Listing 4: Example line for package.provided

sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.11.6</q></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><q>To get librarys or apps into the search path so that other applications could use it AND to get zero install apps to not use the librarys coming with the distribution.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>While it is not particularly difficult to do the initial install the launcher, it is quite annoying to have to do it on every machine on which I use it. It would be helpful if distributions started shipping with it and made it part of the base install for at least desktop systems.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Didnt find it really confusing... but it would be nice if Zero Install could rally more people behind its idea AND that it would be able to continue if main devs no longer have time to maintain (I see that Elektra registry project moves so slow for example, that makes me worried)</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>To integrate it nicely in my system.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It could be more easier or intuitive, like mac program installs or windows installers</q></p></blockquote><h3>Any other comments?</h3><blockquote><p><q>In the "Which of these features do you use?" section, "No answer" corresponds to "I do not use this feature at the moment, but that doesn't mean I don't need it, or value its presence".</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>No infrastructure for managing packages, building for multiple architectures, dealing with portability issues, etc.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>To the question "What is Zero Install's biggest weakness?", I want to add that more packages would be nice.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Great concept! I can't wait until distributions get rid of the creativity stifling easy-to-break centralized package management model and adopt zeroinstall's (at least for everything but the core of the OS)</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>0install is superb, thanks a lot for it. I will reinstall it in my Sabayon/Gentoo Linux on 64 bits and I will see how can it provide me for the packages I want, optimized for this architecture. Cheers</q></p></blockquote>

also the package manager of the distribution should be able to use it like for instance portage that can use .deb or rpms</q></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><q>Because i make ebuilds...but if zero install works across all distribution it's great</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The real reasons I like to distribute software through zeroinstall:
* my user's shouldn't need root access or much experience with installing software from source
* zeroinstall checks for updates every so often for them, so I know that it is unlikely that many people will be using very out-of-date versions of my projects.

Again, keep up the excellent work!</q></p></blockquote>
