  <summary>WYSIWYM(ean) document processor</summary>
  <description>
LyX is an advanced open source document processor running on many Unix and some
non-Unix platforms. It is called a &quot;document processor&quot;, because unlike standard
word processors, LyX encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of
your documents, not their appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing,
leaving details of visual layout to the software.

LyX automates formatting according to predefined rule sets, yielding consistency
throughout even the most complex documents. LyX produces high quality,
professional output -- using LaTeX, an open source, industrial strength
typesetting engine, in the background.

With LyX, short notes or letters are a snap. LyX really shines, though, when
composing complex documents like technical documentation, doctoral theses and
conference proceedings.</description>
