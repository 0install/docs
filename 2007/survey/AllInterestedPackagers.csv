I can imagine many packages would fail without Python, or GTK, but it somehow seems like a lot of work packaging things like that that we assume are on most systems. I certainly don\'t want to be packaging a lot of dependencies just to get one package working. We could do with a core library of dependencies being packaged, and then everybody could link to them, and perhaps they could be included in 0publish as standard dependencies. Also, it may be possible to examine the current machine to see if the dependencies are already there - i.e. check if GTK exists at a specified version, if not download the 0install package, if it is we\'re alright. If 0install is to become more widely-adopted, we need more stringent dependency-listing because more people will be using it on more systems.","In the \""Which of these features do you use?\"" section, \""No answer\"" corresponds to \""I do not use this feature at the moment, but that doesn\'t mean I don\'t need it, or value its presence\"".","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Because I like 0install, and I support it by packaging software.

Again, keep up the excellent work!",
