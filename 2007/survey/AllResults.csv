We could do with a core library of dependencies being packaged, and then everybody could link to them, and perhaps they could be included in 0publish as standard dependencies. Also, it may be possible to examine the current machine to see if the dependencies are already there - i.e. check if GTK exists at a specified version, if not download the 0install package, if it is we\'re alright.

Using Portage with Self-Maintained Software

In some cases you want to configure, install and maintain software yourself without having Portage automate the process for you, even though Portage can provide the software titles. Known cases are kernel sources and nvidia drivers. You can configure Portage so it knows that a certain pack stage is manually installed on your system. This process is called injecting and supported by Portage through the /etc/portage/profile/package.provided file.

For instance, if you want to inform Portage about gentoo-sources-2.6.11.6 which you\'ve installed manually, add the following line to /etc/portage/profile/package.provided:

Code Listing 4: Example line for package.provided

sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-2.6.11.6
