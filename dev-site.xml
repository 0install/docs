<h2>Developers: the 0install web-site</h2>

<p>
  The 0install.net site is held in a Git repository. If you want to work on it, you can
  clone it like this:
</p>

<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/0install/web-site.git
</pre>

<p>
  Run <b>make</b> to generate the .html files from the .xml ones. The XML syntax is basically
  HTML, but an XSLT stylesheet generates the navigation.
</p>

<p>
  To add a new page:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy one of the existing .xml files to create the new page.</li>
  <li>Add it to the Makefile so it gets built.</li>
  <li>Add it to structure.xml to put it in the navigation.</li>
  <li>Add it to Git with "git add page.xml".</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To update the actual site:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you don't have admin access, submit a pull request to the <a href='https://github.com/0install/web-site'>GitHub "web-site" project</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are an admin, run the <b>deploy-to-github-pages.sh</b> script. This will create a temporary subdirectory called <b>github-tmp</b>, run <b>make</b> it in, commit the generated files and push to the (auto-generated) <b>gh-pages</b> branch. The changes will appear immediately on the site.
</li>
</ul>
