<h2>0compile</h2>

<p>
Normally, Zero Install will select a pre-built binary for your system. However, it can also be used to compile
a new binary from a source package. This is useful if:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>no binary is available for your platform;</li>
 <li>you wish to build using different library versions; or</li>
 <li>you wish to make changes to a program or library.</li>
</ul>

<toc level='h2'/>

<h2>Creating the build environment</h2>

<p>
To get started, run <b>0compile setup</b> with the URL of the program you want
to build. In this example, we'll use <a
href='http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/'>GNU-Hello</a>, a simple program
written by the FSF to demonstrate use of the popular GNU build tools:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0compile setup http://0install.net/tests/GNU-Hello.xml GNU-Hello</b>
</pre>

<p>
<b>0compile</b> will run <b>0launch --source</b> to select a
suitable version of the source code and download it. It will also locate and
download any dependencies (e.g. build tools or header files) the source may
have, although the <b>GNU-Hello</b> example interface doesn't list any.  </p>

<p>
The final argument names a directory for the build environment. If omitted, it defaults
to the last component of the URI, without the ".xml" extension (so we could
have just left it off in this case). <b>0compile</b> will create this directory
in the current directory.
</p>

<p>
All further <b>0compile</b> commands are run from inside this new directory,
which is currently empty except for a <b>0compile-env.xml</b> file recording
the version of GNU-Hello selected. If you want to change the selected
version(s) later, do:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>cd GNU-Hello</b>
$ <b>0compile setup</b>
</pre>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>
To compile the program, use the <b>build</b> command (from inside the <b>GNU-Hello</b> directory):
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0compile build</b>
</pre>

<p>
<b>0compile</b> starts by creating two sub-directories: <b>dist</b> for the
final result, and <b>build</b> for any temporary files. The source interface
states that this program uses the standard GNU build system, so <b>0compile</b>
does the familiar <b>configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</b> sequence, except that instead of
installing into <b>/usr/local</b>, it passes options to <b>configure</b> to
install into the new <b>dist</b> directory.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the build is successful, <b>dist</b> will contain the final result,
including a handy <b>dist/GNU-Hello.xml</b> local feed file, which you can use to
run the new binary:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch dist/GNU-Hello.xml</b>
Hello, world!
</pre>

<p>
In fact, since <b>GNU-Hello</b> doesn't list any dependencies, we could have just run
the <b>dist/hello</b> binary directory in this case. For more complex programs,
the interface file will be useful. You can also pass it to <b>0launch
--feed</b> to register the new binary under the program's normal URL:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch --feed dist/GNU-Hello.xml</b>
</pre>

<p>
If everything worked, you can now delete the <b>build</b> directory to save
space. However, if you're planning to modify the source and rebuild (described
in the next section) then you'll want to leave it there, as it will make
rebuilding faster.
</p>

<p>
For future reference, there is also a <b>dist/build-environment.xml</b>  file. This is a copy
of the <b>0compile.xml</b> used for the build, but with a few extra details of the build added,
including the hostname of the machine used for the build, a timestamp and your username. This file
is written before the build starts, so the build process may add to it (or move it, or even delete
it if you don't want it).
</p>

<h2>Modifying the source</h2>

<p>
By default, <b>0compile</b> keeps the source code in the (read-only) Zero Install cache, so if you
want to make changes, the first step is to make a copy of it:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0compile copy-src</b>
$ <b>cd src</b>
</pre>

<p>
Edit the source as needed. Recompile with <b>0compile</b> in the main <b>GNU-Hello</b> directory
as before:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>cd ..</b>
$ <b>0compile build</b>
</pre>

<p>
If you compare the new <b>dist</b> directory with the old one, you'll discover a couple of differences (besides
any changes you actually made):
</p>

<ul>
 <li>The version number in the local feed has <b>-patched</b> appended, to indicate that this version has been modified.</li>
 <li>A new file is present, <b>dist/from-VERSION.patch</b>, containing a diff between the original sources and
 your modified ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These two features make it very easy to keep track of what you changed, which may well come in useful later!
</p>

<h2>Publishing the binary</h2>

<p>
To share our new binary with other people, we just need to archive up the
<b>dist</b> directory and upload it to an FTP or HTTP server somewhere.
Pass the URL of the remote directory to <b>0compile</b> and upload the
resulting binary:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0compile publish http://mysite/downloads</b>
$ <b>scp GNU-Hello-VERSION.tar.bz2 mysite:/var/www/downloads/</b>
</pre>

<p>
As well as the <b>.tar.bz2</b> file, you will also get a
<b>GNU-Hello-VERSION.xml</b> file in the main <b>GNU-Hello</b> directory.
You can use this new XML file to download the archive and run the program:</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch GNU-Hello-VERSION.xml</b>
</pre>

<p>
You can either ask the maintainer of the program to add the implementation in this file to the
master interface, or you can create your own feed (and ask them to add that).
See the <a href='0publish.html'>0publish page</a> for full details, but as a quick summary
you can create a new signed feed like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0publish .../GNU-Hello.xml \
  --xmlsign \
  --set-interface-uri=http://mysite/interfaces/GNU-Hello.xml \
  --local=GNU-Hello-VERSION.xml</b>
</pre>

<p>
Then upload the signed <b>.../GNU-Hello.xml</b> file and the exported GPG key to your webserver.
</p>

<h2>Making source available</h2>
<p>
If you wish to make source code available for others to use (as described above) then you need to add source
implementations to the program's interface file. This is almost exactly the same as adding binaries, except that
you give <b>src</b> as the machine type to <b>0publish</b>:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0publish /var/www/interfaces/MyProg.xml \
  --add-version=5 \
  --archive-url=http://mysite/downloads/myprog-5-src.tar.bz2 \
  --set-released=today \
  --set-arch=*-src</b>
</pre>

<p><b>TODO</b> need to tell 0compile <i>how</i> to build it</p>

<p>
Often people keep the source implementations in a separate file (<b>MyProg-src.xml</b>) and add a feed from
the main interface, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;feed src='http://mysite/interfaces/MyProg<b>-src</b>.xml' <b>arch='*-src'</b>/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <b>arch</b> attribute lets the injector know that it doesn't need to fetch this file unless
it's looking for source code.
