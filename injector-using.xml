<h2>Trying it out the injector</h2>

<p>
Now that you've <a href='injector.html'>installed the injector</a>, let's try using it to
get more software.
</p>

<!--
<div class='note'>
<strong>2005-10-30</strong> It seems that <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4390048.stm'>our
university department has burned down</a>. This probably explains why DNS isn't working. Therefore, please
add this line to your <b>/etc/hosts</b> file:
<pre>
66.35.250.210   0install.net
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example: Running Edit with the injector</h3>

<p>
Run <b>0launch</b> (as a normal user, <b>not</b> as root!), giving it the URL
for the program you want to run:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
</pre>

<ul>
<li>If you get an error running this command, jump to
<a href='injector-trouble.html'>the trouble-shooting section</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="575" height="327" src="confirm-tal.png"
     alt="Confirming Thomas Leonard's GPG key" />
</p>

<p>
So what happened?
</p>

<ol>
<li>The injector realised that it needed to download some files to run Edit, so
it switched to graphical mode (use <b>--console</b> to disable this).</li>
<li>First, it checks for updates to the graphical user interface (GUI) itself.
It downloaded the GUI's interface file, which tells it which versions are
available.</li>
<li>The injector prompts you to confirm that you will accept software signed with my key.</li>
<li>If a newer version of the GUI was found, you would be prompted to download it (or choose
a different version) at this point.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having got a copy of the GUI that everyone is happy with, the injector proceeds to
run Edit in the same way:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It downloads Edit's interface file.</li>
<li>Edit is also signed with my key, so you don't have to confirm a second time.</li>
<li>Edit requires the ROX-Lib library, so it fetches ROX-Lib's interface too. This is
also signed with my key.</li>
<li>It selects suitable versions of Edit and ROX-Lib and prompts you to accept them:</li>
</ol>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="545" height="325" src="edit-injector.png"
     alt="Running Edit with the injector" />
</p>

<p>
The main part of the window contains a list of all the components needed to run Edit.
At the top is Edit itself, and shown below is ROX-Lib, which Edit needs in order to function.
If you are happy with the selected versions, click on <b>Execute</b> to run the
program.
</p>

<p>
When you click on <b>Execute</b>, the injector will start downloading the two chosen
versions:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="327" height="144" src="injector-downloading.png"
     alt="Downloading Edit and ROX-Lib" />
</p>

<p>
The downloaded archives are unpacked into temporary directories and their contents
checked against the digests in the interface files. If correct, the extracted directories
are placed in a cache to save having to download them again next time you run Edit. The injector
does not put files anywhere except in the cache, and uses a separate sub-directory for each
archive it downloads. Each sub-directory is named after the digest of its contents, which allows
downloads to be shared safely between users.
</p>

<div class='note'>TODO: Archives are currently cached in
<b>~/.cache/0install.net/implementations</b>. In future, they will go in
<b>/var/cache/0install.net/implementations</b>, using a setuid helper (which will
check the cryptographic digest of the contents matches the directory name
first, of course).</div>

<p>When the downloads are complete, Edit itself runs:</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="395" height="230" src="edit-running.png"
     alt="Edit running" />
</p>

<p>
By default, the GUI confirmation box is only shown if the injector needs to download something.
If you run the command again once <b>Edit</b> has been cached, Edit will run immediately. To get back to
the dialog box, use the <b>--gui</b> option:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch --gui http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
</pre>

<h2>Creating an alias</h2>

<p>
It's annoying to have to keep typing in the full URL for Edit. The <b>0alias</b> command
can be used to create little shell scripts to start programs easily:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0alias rox-edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
Created script '/home/talex/bin/rox-edit'.
To edit policy: rox-edit --versions
(note: some shells require you to type 'rehash' now)
</pre>

<p>
The command puts the script in the first directory in your $PATH, which must therefore be
writable. You can now run edit like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox-edit</b>
</pre>

<p>
To get back to the policy box (so you can change which versions of Edit and
ROX-Lib you want used), run it like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox-edit --versions</b>
</pre>

<p>
Of course, if you don't normally use the shell for running applications then you should use some other
utility to make new programs easy to run. For example, users of the <a href="http://rox.sf.net">ROX desktop</a>
would run <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/AddApp'>AddApp</a> to create a ROX application
directory launcher.
</p>

<h2>Policy settings</h2>

<p>
You can affect which versions are chosen by changing your policy. Three aspects
of your policy are shown in the main window: <b>Network use</b>, <b>Freshness</b>
and <b>Help test new versions</b>. Click on <b>Help test new versions</b>, and
you may see the version numbers increase, as the injector chooses newer, less
well tested, versions. Note however that you may not see any change at all,
since there may not be new testing versions available when you try it.
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="569" height="364" src="inject.png"
     alt="The injector selects versions according to the user's policy" />
</p>

<p>
To get the injector to notice that a new version is available, click on the <b>Refresh all now</b>
button (which fetches a fresh copy of each listed interface). You can also set the freshness
policy; the injector will automatically check for updates to interfaces that haven't been
checked within the allowed time.
</p>

<p>
These are not the only policy settings. The rest are per-component, and are
accessed by double-clicking on a line in the list. This is described in the following sections.
</p>

<p>Note that all changes to your policy are saved as soon as you make them.
Clicking on <b>Cancel</b> will close the window without running the program,
but any changes made to the policy are not reversed.
</p>


<h3>Choosing different versions</h3>

<p>
The interface URI (<b>http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>) is
used to get the default list of implementations. You can see the information
about an interface by double-clicking on it in the list of interfaces. For
example, double-clicking on <b>Edit</b> displays this dialog box:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
  <img width="756" height="442" src="edit-properties.png"
  	alt="Properties of the Edit interface" />
</p>

<p>
The information displayed is fetched from the interface file, which you can view in
a web browser if you're interested:
<a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit">Edit's interface</a>. This is
a plain-text GPG-signed file. The injector stores the downloaded interface files
locally (in <b>~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces</b>).
</p>

<h3>Stability</h3>

<p>
The interface file also gives a stability rating for each implementation. The following
levels are allowed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Buggy</li>
<li>Insecure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stability ratings are kept independently of the implementations, and are expected to change over
time. When any new release is made, its stability is initially set to <b>Testing</b>. If you
have selected <b>Help test new versions</b> then you will then start using it.
Otherwise, you will continue with the previous stable release. After a while
(days, weeks or months, depending on the project) with no serious problems
found, the author will change the implementation's stability to <b>Stable</b> so that
everyone will use it.
</p>

<p>
If problems are found, it will instead be marked as <b>Buggy</b>, or <b>Insecure</b>. The injector
won't select either by default, but it is useful to see the reason (you might opt to
continue using a buggy version if it works for you, but should never use an insecure
one). <b>Developer</b> is like a more extreme version of <b>Testing</b>, where the program is
expected to have bugs.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <b>Preferred Stability</b> setting in the interface dialog to choose which
versions to use. You can also change the stability rating of any implementation by clicking on it
and choosing a new rating from the popup menu. User-set ratings are shown in capitals.
</p>

<p>
As you make changes to the policy and ratings, the order of the implementations in the list
will change. The version at the top is the one that the injector will actually use. In addition
to the ratings above, you can set the rating to <b>Preferred</b>. Such versions always come first,
unless they're not cached and you are in Off-line mode.
</p>

<p>
Note: If you want to use the second item on the list because the first is
buggy, for example, then it is better to mark the first version as buggy than to mark the
second as preferred. This is because when a new version is available, you will want that to
become the version at the top of the list, whereas a preferred version will always be first.
