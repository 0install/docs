<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Zero Install's <b>0launch</b> command can be run manually, but it is normally invoked by another
program. Some examples include:
</p>

<ul class='spaced'>
 <li>When a <k>GNOME</k> or <k>KDE</k> user drags a web-browser link to the <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/node/402'>Zero2Desktop</a> program, it creates an entry on the <k>Applications menu</k> that uses it.</li>
 <li>When a <k>ROX desktop</k> user drags a web-browser link to the <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/AddApp'>AddApp</a> program, it creates a <k>launcher application</k> that uses it.</li>
 <li>When an <k>Xfce</k> user drags a web-browser link to the <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/node/269'>xfce4-panel</a> program, it creates a <k>launcher button</k> that uses it.</li>
 <li>When a <k>shell</k> user runs the <b>0alias</b> command, it creates a <k>shell short-cut</k> that runs it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this tutorial we'll use the <b>0launch</b> command directly from a shell prompt.
</p>


<h2>Trying out Zero Install</h2>

<p>
Now that you've <a href='injector.html'>installed Zero Install</a>, let's try using it to
get more software.
</p>

<p>
Run <b>0launch</b> from your shell prompt (as a normal user, <b>not</b> as root!), giving it the URL
for the program you want to run. You can get a prompt using a <i>terminal emulator</i>, such as xterm,
gnome-terminal or konsole. For example ($ is the prompt displayed by the computer):
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
</pre>

<ul>
<li>If you get an error running this command, jump to
<a href='injector-trouble.html'>the trouble-shooting section</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="430" height="370" src="confirm-tal.png"
     alt="Confirming Thomas Leonard's GPG key" />
</p>

<p>
So what happened?
</p>

<ol>
<li>It realised that it needed to download some files to run Edit, so
it switched to graphical mode (<a href='http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/1189/focus=1190'>use --console to disable this</a>).</li>
<li>First, it checks for updates to the graphical user interface (GUI) itself.
It downloaded the GUI's <i>feed</i> file, which tells it which versions are
available.</li>
<li>It prompts you to confirm that you will accept software signed with my key.</li>
<li>If a newer version of the GUI was found, you would be prompted to download it (or choose
a different version) at this point.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having got a copy of the GUI that everyone is happy with, it proceeds to
run Edit in the same way:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It downloads Edit's feed file.</li>
<li>Edit is also signed with my key, but you'll be asked to confirm again as Edit is from a different
domain (<b>rox.sourceforge.net</b> rather than <b>0install.net</b>):
<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="430" height="414" src="confirm-tal-rox.png"
     alt="Confirming Thomas Leonard's GPG key again" />
</p></li>

<li>Edit requires the ROX-Lib library, so it fetches ROX-Lib's feed too. This is
also signed with my key and comes from the ROX domain, so you don't need to confirm again.</li>
<li>It selects suitable versions of Edit and ROX-Lib and prompts you to accept them:</li>
</ol>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="500" height="233" src="edit-injector.png"
     alt="Running Edit with the injector" />
</p>

<p>
The main part of the window contains a list of all the components needed to run Edit.
At the top is Edit itself, and shown below is ROX-Lib, which Edit needs in order to function.
If you are happy with the selected versions, click on <b>Run</b> to run the
program.
</p>

<p>
When you click on <b>Run</b>, the two chosen versions will be downloaded:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="327" height="144" src="injector-downloading.png"
     alt="Downloading Edit and ROX-Lib" />
</p>

<p>
The downloaded archives are unpacked into temporary directories and their contents
checked against the digests in the feed files. If correct, the extracted directories
are placed in a cache to save having to download them again next time you run Edit.
No files are placed anywhere except in the cache, and a separate sub-directory is created for each
archive downloaded. Each sub-directory is named after the digest of its contents, which allows
downloads to be shared safely between users.
</p>

<div class='note' style='text-align: left'><h3>Note on sharing downloads</h3>
<p>
By default, archives are cached in <b>~/.cache/0install.net/implementations</b>, 
so if multiple users try to run the same program it will download and save multiple copies.
To allow automatic (and safe) sharing of downloads, see the <a href='sharing.html'>Sharing</a>
page.</p>
</div>

<p>When the downloads are complete, Edit itself runs:</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="395" height="230" src="edit-running.png"
     alt="Edit running" />
</p>

<p>
By default, the GUI confirmation box is only shown if something must be downloaded.
If you run the command again once <b>Edit</b> has been cached, Edit will run immediately. To get back to
the dialog box, use the <b>--gui</b> option:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0launch --gui http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
</pre>

<h2>Creating an alias</h2>

<p>
It's annoying to have to keep typing in the full URL for Edit. The <b>0alias</b> command
can be used to create little shell scripts to start programs easily:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0alias rox-edit http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>
Created script '/home/talex/bin/rox-edit'.
To edit policy: rox-edit --versions
(note: some shells require you to type 'rehash' now)
</pre>

<p>
The command puts the script in the first writable directory in your $PATH.
You can now run Edit like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox-edit</b>
</pre>

<p>
To get back to the policy box (so you can change which versions of Edit and
ROX-Lib you want used), run it like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>rox-edit --versions</b>
</pre>

<p>
Of course, if you don't normally use the shell for running applications then you should use some other
utility to make new programs easy to run. For example, users of the <a href='http://www.xfce.org'>Xfce desktop</a>
can <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/node/269'>drag the URI to the
panel's launcher dialog</a>, while users of the <a href="http://rox.sf.net">ROX
desktop</a> can drag it to <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/AddApp'>AddApp</a> to create a ROX
application directory launcher.
</p>

<h2>Policy settings</h2>

<p>
You can affect which versions are chosen by changing your policy. Three aspects
of your policy are shown in the Preferences window: <b>Network use</b>, <b>Freshness</b>
and <b>Help test new versions</b>:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
  <img width="623" height="478" src="screens/preferences.png" alt='The Preferences dialog'/>
</p>

<p>
Click on <b>Help test new versions</b>, and
you may see the version numbers increase, as newer, less well tested, versions
are chosen.
However, you may not see any change at all, since there may not be new
testing versions available when you try this.
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="569" height="364" src="inject.png"
     alt="Versions are selected according to the user's policy" />
</p>

<p>
To get Zero Install to notice that a new version is available, click on the <b>Refresh all now</b>
button (which fetches a fresh copy of each feed). You can also set the freshness
policy; it will automatically check for updates to feeds that haven't been
checked within the allowed time.
</p>

<p>
These are not the only policy settings. The rest are per-component, and are
accessed by double-clicking on a line in the list. This is described in the following sections.
</p>

<p>Note that all changes to your policy are saved as soon as you make them.
Clicking on <b>Cancel</b> will close the window without running the program,
but any changes made to the policy are not reversed.
</p>


<h3>Choosing different versions</h3>

<p>
The interface URI (<b>http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</b>) is
used to get the default list of implementations. You can see the information
about an interface by double-clicking on it in the list of interfaces. For
example, double-clicking on <b>Edit</b> displays this dialog box:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
  <img width="566" height="420" src="screens/edit-properties.png"
  	alt="Properties of the Edit interface" />
</p>

<p>
The list of feeds shows all the places where Zero Install looks for versions of Edit.
By default, there is just one feed, whose URL is simply Edit's URI; you can
view it in a web browser if you're interested:
<a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit">Edit's default feed</a>. This is
an XML file with a GPG signature at the end. The downloaded feed files are stored
locally in <b>~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces</b>.
</p>

<p>
The Versions tab shows all the versions found in all of the feeds:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
  <img width="557" height="321" src="screens/edit-versions.png"
  	alt="Versions of the Edit" />
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h3>Stability</h3>

<p>
The feed file also gives a stability rating for each implementation. The following
levels are allowed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Buggy</li>
<li>Insecure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stability ratings are kept independently of the implementations, and are expected to change over
time. When any new release is made, its stability is initially set to <b>Testing</b>. If you
have selected <b>Help test new versions</b> in the Preferences dialog box then you will then start using it.
Otherwise, you will continue with the previous stable release. After a while
(days, weeks or months, depending on the project) with no serious problems
found, the author will change the implementation's stability to <b>Stable</b> so that
everyone will use it.
</p>

<p>
If problems are found, it will instead be marked as <b>Buggy</b>, or <b>Insecure</b>. Neither
will be selected by default, but it is useful to see the reason (you might opt to
continue using a buggy version if it works for you, but should never use an insecure
one). <b>Developer</b> is like a more extreme version of <b>Testing</b>, where the program is
expected to have bugs.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <b>Preferred Stability</b> setting in the interface dialog to choose which
versions to use. You can also change the stability rating of any implementation by clicking on it
and choosing a new rating from the popup menu. User-set ratings are shown in capitals.
</p>

<p>
As you make changes to the policy and ratings, the order of the implementations in the list
will change. The version at the top is the one that will actually be used. In addition
to the ratings above, you can set the rating to <b>Preferred</b>. Such versions always come first,
unless they're not cached and you are in Off-line mode.
</p>

<p>
Note: If you want to use the second item on the list because the first is
buggy, for example, then it is better to mark the first version as buggy than to mark the
second as preferred. This is because when a new version is available, you will want that to
become the version at the top of the list, whereas a preferred version will always be first.
</p>

<h2>How to I uninstall things?</h2>

<p>
Click on the <b>Cache</b> button in the main window to get the cache
explorer. Select the versions you don't need anymore and click on <b>Delete</b>.
