<program name='0install'
	 title='Install from Source'
	 author='Thomas Leonard'
	 git='https://github.com/0install/0install'
	 license='GNU Lesser General Public License'>

<p>
  <strong>This is the newer (but less tested) OCaml/Python hybrid version of 0install.</strong>
  There is also an older <a href='install-python.html'>pure Python version</a> (slower, but very mature).
  Both versions have exactly the same features and interface.
</p>
</program>

<p>
  If you are looking for a package, try the <a href='injector.html'>main downloads page</a>. There are also
  some pre-compiled <a href='http://0install.net/tools/0install.xml'>generic Linux binaries</a> available.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Download the latest .tar.bz2 archive from <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zero-install/files/0install/">the
SF.net download page</a> (and the corresponding .sig file if you want to verify it), or using wget:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>wget https://downloads.sf.net/project/zero-install/0install/2.5.1/0install-2.5.1.tar.bz2</b>
$ <b>wget https://downloads.sf.net/project/zero-install/0install/2.5.1/0install-2.5.1.tar.bz2.sig</b>
</pre>

<p>
Check that the signature is correct using GPG (this also ensures that GPG is installed correctly).
You'll need <a href="http://0install.net/public_key.gpg">my GPG key</a>, which you can download and import
using --recv-key (or <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/GPG'>manually</a>):
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>gpg --recv-key --keyserver pgp.mit.edu CA74D8BA</b>
$ <b>gpg 0install-2.5.1.tar.bz2.sig</b>
gpg: Signature made 2013-11-02T22:36:13 GMT using RSA key ID CA74D8BA
gpg: Good signature from "Thomas Leonard &lt;XXXXX@gmail.com>"
gpg: Good signature from "Thomas Leonard &lt;XXXXX@users.sourceforge.net&gt;"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: DA98 25AE CAD0 8975 7CDA  BD8E 0713 3F96 CA74 D8BA
</pre>

<p>
The warning is just to tell you that you haven't yet established that the key really
belongs to me (ultra-paranoid users will now cross-check the finger-print using
some other source of information).
</p>

<p>
  You'll probably need to install some OCaml dependencies before you can build.
  See the <a href='https://github.com/0install/0install/blob/b2.5/README.md'>README</a> for details.
  You should then extract the archive, change directory inside it and build:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>tar xjf 0install-2.5.1.tar.bz2</b>
$ <b>cd 0install-2.5.1</b>
$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
</p>

<table class='split'>
 <col id="col1"/>
 <tr><th>Installing normally</th><th>Installing without root access</th></tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>For a normal install, either su to root, install, and exit from root, or use sudo:</p>
<pre>$ <b>sudo make install</b>
</pre>
 </td><td>
<p>
If you don't have the root password, use this command.
You'll need to make sure that ~/bin is in $PATH in this case.
</p>
<pre>$ <b>make install_home</b>
$ <b>export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH</b>
</pre>
<p>
Logging out and back in again will ensure $PATH and the Applications menu get updated correctly,
on Ubuntu at least.
</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
You now have some new commands: <b>0launch</b>, which takes the URL of a program and runs it, and
<b>0install</b>, which provides access to other features.
