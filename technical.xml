<h2>Technical information and project status</h2>

<h3>Many users, one cache</h3>

<p>Each user has their own customised setup (represented here by Start menus),
which are lists of applications and their corresponding URIs. The cache
is shared by all users.

<h3>Design and implementation details</h3>

<p>
The diagram below shows the components of a Zero Install system. The shaded
parts are only needed when fetching software from the Internet; once software
has been fetched, it can still be used without them.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Applications access resources under the <tt>/uri/0install</tt> directory
using the normal POSIX filesystem interface (open, read, close, etc). The
kernel passes these requests to the LazyFS module, which serves them directly
from the disk cache, if possible.
</p>

<p>
When accessing a resource not in the cache, LazyFS sends a message to the
zero-install program, which fetches it over the Internet and places it in
the cache. Once the software is cached, the application which tried to
access it is woken up, and continues normally.
</p>

<p>
LazyFS and the simple protocol used to communicate with zero-install are
documented in the
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/zero-install/zero-inst/Technical?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/plain">Technical</a> file
in CVS.
</p>

<p>
The user can also communicate with the zero-install program directly. This
is done by programs such as 0refresh (to request the cache be updated) and
ZeroProgress (to tell the user what is currently being fetched). These messages
are in the DBUS format (but no DBUS daemon is used; only the protocol).
</p>

<h3>The index files and mirrors</h3>

<p>
When you access a remote site, zero-install downloads three files from the
remote machine (in one archive): the site's GPG key, the mirrors list, and the
site index's signature. See the <a href="security.html">security page</a> for
information about the key and signature.
</p>

<p>
The mirrors file gives a list of possible download locations. The index list is
then fetched from one of these locations.
This means that only a very small amount of data has to be fetched from the
master server, with web caches, peer-to-peer systems and similar being used for
the (larger) index file.
</p>

<p>
The index lists every file on the site along with its size and mtime. This
allows zero-install to present the complete filesystem to the user with only
the index. The index also organises the files into groups, and gives the name
of an archive containing each group's files along with the archive's MD5 sum.
Because MD5 sums for all the archives are provided in the index, group
archives can be safely downloaded using peer-to-peer systems for greater speed
and reliability.
</p>

<h3>Tasks list</h3>

There is a list of current TODO items on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=76468">Task List</a>. Please 
<a href="support.html">let us know</a> if you want to help out with any of
these.

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>
As an example, the glib library has been packaged for Zero Install.
Programs using it compile using the pkg-config .pc files under /uri and get
the headers from there too. So you don't need glib installed to compile them,
and you don't need it installed to run them :-)
</p>

<p>
The changes required were:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure glib with --prefix=/uri/.../glib/2.2.1/Linux-i386</li>
<li>Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to /uri/.../lib/pkgconfig directory containing .pc
files in Makefile.</li>
<li>Pass --rpath option to linker, giving /uri/.../lib directory.</li>
</ul>

<div class='note'>
<p>
For a better approach than using --rpath, see the
<tt>/uri/0install/zero-install.sourceforge.net/libs/libhello-1.0</tt>
example library, which changes the soname to an absolute path.
