<p>
<a href='injector.html'>0launch</a> is a small Python program. You ask it to run a program by giving
it the program's full name (a web address). Zero Install does <b>not</b> need
to be installed or run as root. It does <b>not</b> write to any of the traditional software
directories (like <b>/usr/bin</b> or <b>/usr/lib</b>). It stores downloads in a cache directory
so that you don't need to download anything twice, and programs can still be used when you are off-line.

  <td><h3>Find a program you want to run on the web</h3>
      <p>If it's a Zero Install program, it will give the URL to use. In this
      example, you would drag <a href='http://www.nongnu.org/clanbomber/zeroinstall/ClanBomber.xml'>the
      ClanBomber link</a> to your installer.</p>

  <td><h3>Give the link to your installer</h3>
      <p>
      Zero Install can be run manually (<b>0launch URL</b>), but it is normally
      invoked by another program. Some examples include:
      </p>
<ul>
 <li>GNOME and KDE users will drag the link to their <b>Add New Program</b> dialog, creating a launcher on their Applications menu.</li>
 <li>ROX or Finder users will drag the link to <a href='http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/AddApp'>AddApp</a>, creating a launcher application that uses 0launch.</li>
 <li>Shell users will run the <b>0alias</b> command, creating a shell short-cut.</li>
</ul>

  <td class='image'><img src='screens/confirm-key.png' alt='' width='400' height='323'/></td>
  <td><h3>Confirm the keys</h3>
      <p>Zero Install downloads information about the program from the given address.</p>
      <p>It checks that the information is signed using a GPG key you trust, confirming first if not.
      Even if you don't know about this key yet, it may provide a hint if it's in its database.</p>

 <tr>
  <td class='image'><img src='screens/find-libraries.png' alt='' width='400' height='264'/></td>
  <td><h3>Finding libraries</h3>
  <p>The downloaded file says that <b>ClanBomber</b> requires various libraries (SDL, libpng, etc).
Each library is identified by a web address (URL) in the same way that the main <b>ClanBomber</b> program was.
Zero Install downloads information about them in the same way. Since they may
be written by different people and be on different sites, you may be asked to confirm more keys. The window
displays a dialog box showing the program and all required libraries. Click <b>Download</b>.</p>
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td class='image'><img src='screens/download-foo.png' alt='' width='400' height='349'/></td>
  <td><h3>Downloading</h3>
  <p>Zero Install now downloads all the required archives (supported formats include tar.gz, tar.bz2, zip, 
RPM, deb and autopackage). It unpacks each one into its own directory and
checks its contents against the <i>cryptographic digest</i>
given in the (signed) feed file. If the archive has been changed since the feed was signed,
the download will be rejected. If the archive hasn't been tampered with, it is stored in a cache directory
(see <a href='sharing.html'>sharing</a> for more information) in its own
subdirectory, named after the digest. This ensures that no two downloads can
conflict with each other.

  <td><h3>Running</h3>
  <p>If you used <a>Add New Program</a>, you should now find the game in your menu. If you used <b>0alias</b>,
  you'll have a new shell command, etc.</p>

  <p>When you run the program, Zero Install will check for updates from time-to-time and may offer to
  download them for you.</p>
