<h2>The Injector: Tests</h2>

<p>
This page contains various tests for the injector itself.
</p>

<h2>Unit tests</h2>

<p>
The injector comes with a suite of unit tests. To run
them, <a href='injector.html'>install the injector</a> and then type:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>cd tests</b>
$ <b>./testall</b>
testDownload (testautopolicy.TestAutoPolicy) ... ok
[...]
testParallel (testtrust.TestTrust) ... ok
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 36 tests in 0.862s

OK
</pre>

<p>
The unit tests do not perform any network access.
</p>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<p>
This section contains some interfaces which test various features of the
injector. Before each test, create a new home directory for the test:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>export HOME=/tmp/injector-test</b>
$ <b>rm -rf /tmp/injector-test; 0launch -cv <i>URL</i></b>
</pre>

<dl>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/missing</dt>

<dd>Interface does not exist. You should get a sensible error message.
</dd>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/newkey</dt>

<dd>This interface is signed with an unknown key. The key should be downloaded
automatically, and you should be prompted to confirm that you trust it.
</dd>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/badurl</dt>
<dd>
This is a correctly signed interface, but at the wrong URL. The injector
should reject it.
</dd>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/newkey.xml</dt>
<dd>
This interface is not signed. It should be rejected.
</dd>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/badsig</dt>
<dd>
This interface has been tampered with. It should be rejected.
</dd>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/multisig</dt>
<dd>
This interface has been signed with multiple keys. You should be prompted
to confirm both.
</dd>

<dt>http://0install.net/tests/master</dt>
<dd>
This interface contains no implementations itself, but has two additional
feeds. The first is always available (sha1=123), while the second will only be
fetched if 'PPC' binaries are supported (sha1=456). (note that the
implementations cannot actually be downloaded).
</dd>

<dt><a href='http://0install.net/tests/xmlsig.xml'>http://0install.net/tests/xmlsig.xml</a></dt>
<dd>
This interface is signed sightly differently. The signature appears in an
XML comment block at the end (meaning that the whole file including the
signature is a valid XML document). It should be accepted (requires
injector version 0.18 or later).
</dd>

<dt><a href='http://0install.net/tests/Tgif.xml'>http://0install.net/tests/Tgif.xml</a></dt>
<dd>
The archive is in RPM format (so you can install directly from the version on bourbon.usc.edu).
It requires injector version 0.18 or later (now <a href='http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=76468'>available through subversion</a>).
