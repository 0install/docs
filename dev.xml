<h2>Developers</h2>

<p>
 This section is for people developing 0install itself, or integrating it
 into their own systems (for example, if you want to use 0install to manage
 plugins for your application).
</p>

<p>
  If you want to make programs available through 0install, see the <a href='packagers.html'>packaging guide</a> instead.

<h3>The Python API</h3>

<p>
  The <b>0launch</b>/<b>0install</b> command-line interface to Zero Install is sufficient for most
  purposes. However, sometimes you may want to use the Python library interface.
  This is used by programs such as <b>0compile</b> and <b>0publish</b>, and is
  also a useful reference for people wanting to modify 0install itself.
