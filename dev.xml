 people working on the Zero Install system itself.

 <dd>
  This guide takes you throught the steps involved in making a package available
  through Zero Install. You will need to be able to upload (static) files to a
  web-server.

  <b>0publish</b> makes it easy to automate the process of making new releases.
  This tutorial shows how to use it, taking the example of creating binary releases
  of ROX-Filer for a new platform.

  Formal specifications for the file formats used by the injector.

  <p>Article showing how to use Zero Install in your build scripts to download the SCons build system and
  use it to compile your program.</p>

 <dd>
  <p>This blog article shows how to use Zero Install to compile your program against older
 versions of library headers than are the default on your system. Binaries created this way
 work on a wider range of systems (all systems with a GTK version newer than the headers). Also,
 since they download the required headers automatically, users don't need to have the headers
 already on their system in order to compile your program.</p>
 <p>
 The binaries produced this way do not depend on Zero Install, so you can use Zero Install as
 part of your build process even if you don't distribute the resulting binaries that way.
