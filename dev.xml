 This section is for people developing 0install itself, or integrating it
 into their own systems (for example, if you want to use 0install to manage
 plugins for your application).

  If you want to make programs available through 0install, see the <a href='packagers.html'>packaging guide</a> instead.

  The <b>0launch</b> command-line interface to Zero Install is sufficient for most

  This is used by programs such as <b>0compile</b> and <b>0publish</b>, and is
  also a useful reference for people wanting to modify 0install itself.
