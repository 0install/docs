<h2>Documentation for users</h2>

<p>
Generally, you don't have to do anything special to use the system.
When you find software on the web which is available via zero install, you'll
be told where it is, and you can run it from there. For example, you can run
ROX-Filer like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>cd /uri/0install/rox.sourceforge.net</b>
$ <b>./rox</b>
</pre>

<p>
To make it easier to find it in future, you should bookmark it somehow.
Some possibilities are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Drag the program from a filer window onto the pinboard or panel,
or add a filer bookmark.
</li>

<li>Add it to a Start menu or other launcher program.</li>

<li>Symlink it into your path, eg (assuming PATH contains ~/bin):
<pre>
$ <b>ln -s /uri/0install/rox.sourceforge.net/rox ~/bin</b>
$ <b>rox</b>
</pre>
</li>

<li>Make a shell alias:
<pre>
$ <b>alias rox='/uri/0install/rox.sourceforge.net/rox'</b>
$ <b>rox</b>
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
There should never be any need to worry about libraries and supporting
programs, because they are all accessed automatically through the cache.
However, you have two further programs to help you interact with the cache:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>ZeroProgress</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This program pops up a status box while a download is in progress.
Run it with the command
<b>/uri/0install/zero-install.sourceforge.net/apps/ZeroProgress/AppRun</b>
(nothing will appear until a download starts). You can right-click over an
entry in the list to bring up a menu, which can be used to cancel the
download.
</p>
<p style='text-align: center'>
<img src='progress.png' width='565' height='235'
     alt='GUI progress indicator' />
</p>
</dd>

<dt>0refresh</dt>
<dd>For speed reasons, the cache is never automatically updated. If you
know that gimp2.0 is available, but /uri/0install/www.gimp.org only has a gimp1.3
subdirectory then you can run 0refresh to update it:
<pre>
$ <b>cd /uri/0install/www.gimp.org</b>
$ <b>ls</b>
gimp1.2
gimp1.3
$ <b>0refresh</b>
$ <b>ls</b>
gimp1.2
gimp1.3
gimp2.0
</pre>

<p>Running 0refresh updates the index for the whole site, so everything
under www.gimp.org will be up-to-date afterwards. You don't have to run it in
each subdirectory. Of course, the actual files are still only downloaded when
you try to access them.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/623">DBus.error.Disconnected: Disconnected before receiving a reply</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/740">assertion failed "!_dbus_transport_get_is_connected"</a> (0refresh works; the error is harmless)</li>
</ul>

<!--
<div class='note'>
<h3>GPG errors with 0refresh?</h3>
<p>
When updating a site, zero-install checks that the new index is signed by
a trusted key (either the last key to sign the index, or a key signed by
that key). If it doesn't work, you should notify the site owner that their
site may have been broken in to.
</p>
<p>
If you are <strong>sure</strong> that the site is valid despite the warning,
you can bypass the check by deleting the file
<tt>/var/cache/zero-inst/SITE/.0inst-meta/trusted_key</tt>.

<h2>Documentation for admins</h2>

<p>Setting up a computer so that it can use Zero Install is covered in
detail in the <a href="install.html">Install Guide</a>.</p>

<p>You may also be interested in the <a href="security.html">security model</a>
essay.</p>

<p>Generally, you don't need to do anything to install software. That
all happens automatically and safely. However, you can override any
particular resource using the <tt>0divert</tt> command. This command
creates a symlink in the /uri/0install filesystem, allowing you to replace
resources. For example, if the new ROX-Lib is buggy:</p>

<pre>
$ <b>alias 0divert=/uri/0install/zero-install.sourceforge.net/bin/0divert</b>
$ <b>cd /uri/0install/rox.sourceforge.net/lib/ROX-Lib2</b>
$ <b>file latest</b>
latest: symbolic link to `ROX-Lib-1.9.9'
$ <b>0divert latest ROX-Lib-1.9.8</b>
$ <b>file latest</b>
latest: symbolic link to `ROX-Lib-1.9.8'
</pre>

<p>
You can remove the diversion with <tt>0divert -r</tt>, and can get a list
of current diversions with <tt>0divert -l [site]</tt>. Removing a diversion
puts things back the way they were:
</p>

<pre>
$ <b>0divert -l rox.sourceforge.net</b>
/lib/ROX-Lib2/latest -> ROX-Lib-1.9.8 (set Sat Aug 23 14:38:39 2003)
$ <b>0divert -r latest</b>
$ <b>file latest</b>
latest: symbolic link to `ROX-Lib-1.9.9'
</pre>

<p>0divert is also useful if there is no binary available for your platform.
You can create a directory for the build and use <tt>0divert</tt> to create a
platform symlink to it, then build there.</p>

<h3>Dist-upgrade</h3>

<p>
If you want to upgrade everything, run 0refresh on every cached site:
</p>

<pre>
$ cd /var/cache/zero-inst
$ for x in *; do 0refresh "$x"; done
</pre>

<p>
This will update every cached index file. The actual data will be fetched on
demand.
</p>

<h3>Cleaning the cache</h3>

<p>
If you run low on disk space, you can use
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.zero-install.devel/619">ZeroClean</a>
to find old files in the cache, and remove them:
</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>
<img width="618" height="338" src="ZeroClean.png"
     alt='ZeroClean finds some files to remove' />
</p>
