<h3>Language-specific package managers</h3>

<p>
  Most programming languages need a way to share libraries. Relying on native package managers doesn't work for the usual reasons (e.g. Windows doesn't have a package manager, developers like their packages to be up-to-date, developers don't like installing build dependencies as root, it should be possible to use a library without getting it added to every distribution's repository, etc).
</p>
<p>
  Using a generic package manager brings a number of advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can depend on things written in other languages (e.g, you can depend on the compiler, build tools and documentation formatters, not just on libraries in your own language).</li>
  <li>You can use the same technology to distribute the resulting programs after building them, if you want.</li>
  <li>You get access to robust code that already covers many cases you might not have considered (e.g. resolving complex dependency requirements, support for other platforms, checking digital signatures, etc).</li>
  <li>Users only have to learn one extra package manager, not one per language.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Since 0install is ideal for this kind of thing, we are collecting feedback from projects which have decided to build their own systems instead.
