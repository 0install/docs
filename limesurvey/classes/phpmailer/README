PHPMailer
Full Featured Email Transfer Class for PHP
==========================================

http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/

This software is licenced under the LGPL.  Please read LICENSE for information on the
software availability and distribution.

Class Features:
- Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
- Redundant SMTP servers
- Multipart/alternative emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email
- Support for 8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable encoding
- Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail active server (COM) component
- SMTP authentication
- Native language support
- Word wrap, and more!

Why you might need it:

Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function
that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose
any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like
HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary
development tools out there that have all the functionality built into
easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these
programs are COM components only available on Windows.  They are also a
little pricey for smaller projects.

Since I do Linux development I’ve missed these tools for my PHP coding.
So I built a version myself that implements the same methods (object
calls) that the Windows-based components do. It is open source and the
LGPL license allows you to place the class in your proprietary PHP
projects.


Installation:

Copy class.phpmailer.php into your php.ini include_path. If you are
using the SMTP mailer then place class.smtp.php in your path as well.
In the language directory you will find several files like 
phpmailer.lang-en.php.  If you look right before the .php extension 
that there are two letters.  These represent the language type of the 
translation file.  For instance "en" is the English file and "br" is 
the Portuguese file.  Chose the file that best fits with your language 
and place it in the PHP include path.  If your language is English 
then you have nothing more to do.  If it is a different language then 
you must point PHPMailer to the correct translation.  To do this, call 
the PHPMailer SetLanguage method like so:

// To load the Portuguese version
$mail->SetLanguage("br", "/optional/path/to/language/directory/");

That's it.  You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!


A Simple Example:

<?php
require("class.phpmailer.php");

$mail = new PHPMailer();

$mail->IsSMTP();                                      // set mailer to use SMTP
$mail->Host = "smtp1.example.com;smtp2.example.com";  // specify main and backup server
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;     // turn on SMTP authentication
$mail->Username = "jswan";  // SMTP username
$mail->Password = "secret"; // SMTP password

$mail->From = "from@example.com";
$mail->FromName = "Mailer";
$mail->AddAddress("josh@example.net", "Josh Adams");
$mail->AddAddress("ellen@example.com");                  // name is optional
$mail->AddReplyTo("info@example.com", "Information");

$mail->WordWrap = 50;                                 // set word wrap to 50 characters
$mail->AddAttachment("/var/tmp/file.tar.gz");         // add attachments
$mail->AddAttachment("/tmp/image.jpg", "new.jpg");    // optional name
$mail->IsHTML(true);                                  // set email format to HTML

$mail->Subject = "Here is the subject";
$mail->Body    = "This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>";
$mail->AltBody = "This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients";

if(!$mail->Send())
{
   echo "Message could not be sent. <p>";
   echo "Mailer Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo;
   exit;
}

echo "Message has been sent";
