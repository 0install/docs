Use your own logo
-----------------

To use your own logo, replace the logo.png file.
Different sizes are OK.  The example logo is 200 x 35 pixels, 
but there is plenty of space to use a logo of any size.

If your logo has a different image format (e.g., .gif),
change the file name in survey.pstpl

Change style
------------

Style (font, colour, etc.) is edited in startpage.pstpl
