LimeSurvey is a set of PHP scripts aimed at allowing people to develop online Surveys.

Using LimeSurvey it is possible to:

1) Develop surveys (multiple surveys possible);
2) Create a database for collecting survey data;
3) Use one of two different ways for responding to the survey
    a) Basic dataentry
    b) User friendly web based form
4) Maintain a database of people invited to participate in the survey, and keep a record of who has participated and who has not (if required)
5) Export the survey structure, survey responses and user information for any surveys.

The script was developed for quick dataentry with paper based responses to surveys, but has been extended to allow for web-based presentation of surveys.

The script is written in PHP, using a MySQL or MS SQL database. It has been succesfully run it on Linux and Windows XP using Apache and believe it would work on Microsoft IIS although the security features would have to be handled manually.

I have not been able to find any similar open-source scripts anywhere on the web, so I believe it differs in that regard. It is useful for people who want to be able to develop relatively complicated surveys and then perform dataentry on those surveys, or allow public responses via the internet.

The project does not aim to provide any data-analysis on survey results, but to allow exporting of those results into spreadsheet format.
