This document is a formal description of the interface XML file format. An interface file describes a program,
library or other component. It also provides a list of known implementations of the interface (versions of the program)
and details about how to get them, how to check that they are authentic, how to run them and what other components
they depend on.

Zero Install implementations are directory trees identified by an
algorithm name (e.g., "sha1"), and digest of their contents calculated using
that algorithm. Adding, deleting, renaming or modifying any file in a tree will
change its digest. It should be infeasibly difficult to generate a new tree
with the same digest as a given tree. Thus, if you know the digest of the
implementation you want, and someone gives you a tree with that digest, you can
trust that it is the implementation you want. This document describes how a
digest is calculated from a directory tree.
